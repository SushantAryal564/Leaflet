  - Factories or constructor method
    .parameter
    .options parameter
  -Events
    . Event Object

  Leaflet Basic Types
  .LatLng - Defines a points
    .var IICenter = L.latLng(195,-88.2)
    .var IICenter = L.LatLng([19.5,-99.5])
    .var IICenter = L.LatLng({lat:19.5,lng:-99.2,alt:1200})
  
  .LatLngBounds - Defines a rectangles
    .var IIcrnr1 = L.latLng(40,50);
2. Leaflet Plug-ins
   -Leaflet is lightweight
   -Leaflet requres plugins to provide extended features that aren't native in other API's
   -Plug-ins are
    -Code that someone else wrote to add functionality that is not included in the leaflet core:
      -Javascripts
      -css
   -There are a large number of plug-ins available.

4. The Leaflet Map Object
   When we click on a map DOM event is used so when we click on the dom element that contain a leaflet map that click event in the dom elements get passed down to leaflet and leaflet creates another event this leaflet event has latlng information. Leaflet take screen coordinate and convert it to the geographic coordinate.
