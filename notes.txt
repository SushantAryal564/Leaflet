Leaflet

1. Leaflet Documentation
-Leaflet is made up of object classes
-These object all have
  - Factories or constructor method
    .parameter
    .options parameter
  -Events
    . Event Object
  -Methods
    .paramters
    .return value
  -Properties
  We assign instance of those objects to variables in order to interact with them

  Leaflet Basic Types
  .LatLng - Defines a points
    .var IICenter = L.latLng(195,-88.2)
    .var IICenter = L.LatLng([19.5,-99.5])
    .var IICenter = L.LatLng({lat:19.5,lng:-99.2,alt:1200})
  
  .LatLngBounds - Defines a rectangles
    .var IIcrnr1 = L.latLng(40,50);
2. Leaflet Plug-ins
   -Leaflet is lightweight
   -Leaflet requres plugins to provide extended features that aren't native in other API's
   -Plug-ins are
    -Code that someone else wrote to add functionality that is not included in the leaflet core:
      -Javascripts
      -css
   -There are a large number of plug-ins available.

3. The Leaflet Map objects
   .options
    .zoomcontrol
    .attributionControl
    .center
    .zoom
    .minZoom
    .maxZoom
    .layers
    .maxBounds
    .dragging
   .Events
    .Layers Events: When layers are added or removes
    .Map state change Event: Before and or after panning or zooming
    .Geolocation Events: When geolocation succeeds or fails
    .Interaction Events: Mouse click,hover,keypress,
   .Methods
    .addControl, removeControl
    .addLayer, removeLayer
    .hasLayer:returns true or false depending where layer is present in map or not
    .eachLayer:takes callback function to run for each layers
    .openPopup,closePopup
    .locate
    .stopLocate
    .distance
    .getCenter, getBounds
    .panTo, fitBounds
    .setView
    .getZoom, setZoom
    .zoomIn, zoomOut
    .getMinZoom, setMinZoom
    .getMaxZoom, setMaxZoom

4. The Leaflet Map Object
   When we click on a map DOM event is used so when we click on the dom element that contain a leaflet map that click event in the dom elements get passed down to leaflet and leaflet creates another event this leaflet event has latlng information. Leaflet take screen coordinate and convert it to the geographic coordinate. 

5. The Leaflet Location Methods
   It's map location method by which we access the location of the map and by which we can either zoom to current location on earth or add gps location to a map.

6. Leaflet Popups
   Popups are a common feature in web mapping
   Most commonly used to display properties of a feature when its clicked on
   You can bind a popup to an individual feature using the feature bindPopup method
   You can also place a popup directly on the map with no features
   can contain HTML <img>,<button>,<form>
   POPUP OPTIONS, METHODS,Events
    constructor
      L.popup(options)
    options
      minWidth,maxWidth
      maxHeight
      autoPan
      KeepInview
      closeButton
      autoClose
    Methods
      getLatlng,setLatLng
      getContent,setContent
      isOpen
      openOn
      bringToFront, bringToBack
    Other objects
      bindPopup
      openPopup

7. Native Leaflet Controls
   Controls are map elements used to handle user interaction with the map
   Controls are simply HTML elements
   Controls are simply HTML elements
    The zoom control is an html elements containing two buttons
  Leaflet handles placing the control in the following position:
    Topleft,topright,bottomleft,bottomright
  The basic process is to:
    Create an instance of the control using is constructor method and setting its options
    Add it to the map
  
  Leaflet Controls
  .Control Methods
    .getPosition,setPosition
    .getContainer
    .addTo,remove
  . There are 4 controls native to leaflet
    . Zoom: visible by default
    .Attribution: handles citation of map layers, visible by default
    .Scale: a scale bar
    .Layers: allows switching background layers and turning overlay layers on and off.
  
  Leaflet Control (Plugins)
  i. Pan Control
  ii. Zoom Slider
  iii. Mouse Cursor
  iv. ScaleFactor
  v. Measure
  vi. Easy button
  vii. side bar
  viii. Magnifying glass
  ix. Mini map
  x. Sync
  xi. Geocoding
  xii. Routing

  Introduction to Layers
  Layers in Leaflets
  .BaseMaps
    .Raster background layer
    .TileLayers
      .individual Image(256*256)
      .The tiles are index spatially so its easy for the software to quickly find exactly which tiles are needed to fill the current map view. 
      .There are different set of tiles for each zoom level.
    .One active at a time
    .Custom BaseMaps
    
  .Overlays Layers
    .vector-GeoJSON
    .Layer = 1 feature
    .FeatureGroup = Multiple feature
    .ImageOverlay
